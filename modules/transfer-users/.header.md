# AWS Transfer Family User Import Module

This module allows import of SFTP users for AWS Transfer Family servers.

## Overview

The Transfer Users module handles:

- SFTP user import
- IAM role and policy configuration
- S3 bucket access permissions
- Optional test user creation

## Features

### User Management

This module provides user import functionality for AWS Transfer Family. For example CSV configuration and implementation, see the ([../examples/sftp-public-endpoint-service-managed-S3/README.md#user-management](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-transfer-family/blob/dev/examples/sftp-public-endpoint-service-managed-S3/.header.md)) in the SFTP public endpoint example.

Key capabilities:

- Bulk user creation via CSV file
- Home directory mapping to S3 paths:

```
home_directory_type = "LOGICAL"
home_directory_mappings {
  entry = "/"
  target = "/${s3_bucket_name}${home_dir}"
}
```

### Security Configuration

- IAM role creation
- Fine-grained S3 bucket access controls
- KMS encryption support for S3
- SSH key pair generation for test users. NOT FOR PRODUCTION!

## Module Structure

### Core Resources

- `aws_transfer_user`: Creates SFTP users in AWS Transfer Family
- `aws_transfer_ssh_key`: Creates SSH keys for test user only
- `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_role_policy`: Sets up IAM roles and policies for user access
- `aws_secretsmanager_secret`: Stores SSH keys for test users (when enabled)

### Key Configurations

- User home directory mapping to S3 paths
- IAM policies for S3 and KMS access
- Optional test user creation with automated key generation

## IAM Permissions

The module creates IAM roles with permissions for:

- S3 bucket listing and object operations
- KMS key usage for encryption/decryption
- Transfer Family service assume role capabilities

## Best Practices

- Use the `users` variable for bulk user management
- Implement custom IAM roles for granular access control
- Regularly rotate SSH keys for production users
- Monitor user access patterns through CloudWatch Logs
- Use KMS encryption for enhanced security of S3 data and Secrets Manager

## Considerations

- Ensure the AWS region is consistent across all related resources
- Be cautious with the `create_test_user` option in production environments
- Regularly review and update IAM policies to maintain least privilege
